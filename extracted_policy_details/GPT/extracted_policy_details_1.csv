"Calculate Debt Payments as Stated on Credit Bureau"                    , "M"    , "Partially. Meridian generally uses the payment amounts as stated on the credit bureau for debts unless their policy specifies a higher payment. For example, for credit cards and unsecured lines of credit, they use the greater of 3% of the balance or the bureau-reported payment. For fixed loans (e.g., car loans, student loans in repayment), they use the actual monthly payment shown on the bureau."
"Calculate Debt Payments at BoC Rate Over 25 Years"                     , "Y"    , "No. Instead of using a Bank of Canada benchmark rate, Meridian calculates payments for secured lines of credit based on a 25-year amortization at the 5-year contract rate (the rate of the mortgage).

"Calculate Debt Payments at the Total Limit"                            , "Y"    , "Yes, for HELOCs. For secured revolving credit (HELOCs), Meridian assumes the entire credit limit is utilized and calculates a payment based on amortizing that limit over 25 years at the 5-year rate. For unsecured revolving credit (credit cards/lines), they use the outstanding balance (with 3% payment) rather than the full limit."
"Calculate Debt Payments on Unsecured Loans"                            , "M"    , "Standard practice. For unsecured installment loans (e.g., personal loans), Meridian uses the actual monthly payment as reported on the credit bureau (no additional imputed payment, since no special rule is stated)."

"OSAP (3% or Payment on Credit Bureau)"                                 , "Y"    , "Yes (treated as other student debt). For student lines of credit, use the greater of 3% of the balance or the payment on the bureau. For student loans in repayment (like OSAP after graduation), use the monthly payment shown on the credit bureau. If a government student loan is not yet in repayment, use the future payment as per the government’s loan repayment estimator."
"Property Tax Calculation"                                              , "Y"    , "If actual property taxes are unknown (e.g., for new builds), Meridian uses reasonable estimates. Acceptable methods: builder’s tax estimate, or the average taxes from similar listings, or an appraiser’s estimate. If none of those are available, use 0.75% of the purchase price as the tax estimate."
"Secured Revolving Debt Payments (HELOC)"                               , "Y"    , "For secured lines of credit (HELOCs), the payment for debt servicing is based on the approved credit limit amortized over 25 years at the 5-year contract interest rate. (This effectively assumes the HELOC is fully drawn.)"

"Student LOC (3% or Payment on Credit Bureau)"                          , "Y"    , "Yes. For student line of credit debts, Meridian uses the greater of 3% of the outstanding balance or the payment reported on the credit bureau (same treatment as other unsecured lines of credit)."
"2nd Mortgage Allowed Behind You"                                       , "Y"    , "Not for purchases. Meridian does not allow a second mortgage to be placed behind their first mortgage at the time of purchase. (In other words, no secondary financing, like a VTB or other lender second, is permitted at closing.)"
"2nd Mortgages (Lender Arranged)"                                       , "M"    , "Limited. Meridian will consider a second-position mortgage only behind an existing Meridian first mortgage.

"Bridge Financing"                                                      , "Y"    , "Yes. Meridian offers bridge financing for interim closings. It’s available through the broker channel with advance notice and is typically capped at 90 days. The rate for bridge loans is Meridian Prime + 2%, and there is a $250 application fee. (Brokers should note on submission if bridge financing is required.)"

"Insured Switch/Transfer"                                               , "Y"    , "Yes. Meridian will accept transfers (“switches”) of existing first mortgages that are insured or insurable as is. (If the mortgage fails to meet insurable criteria, it isn’t treated as a straight switch but rather as a refinance with full underwriting)."
"Max Rate Holds (Days)"                                                 , "Y"    , "120 days. Meridian’s rate hold commitment is valid for up to 120 days on both purchases (including new builds) and refinances."

"Penalty Calculations for Breaking Mortgage"                            , "Y"    , "For fixed-rate mortgages, Meridian uses an IRD (interest rate differential) formula based on their posted (floor) rates. The penalty is calculated using the original posted rate for the mortgage and the posted rate for the remaining term at the time of payout. (3 months’ interest applies for variable-rate mortgages.)"
"Portable"                                                              , "Y"    , "Yes. Meridian’s mortgages are portable to another residential property in Ontario (allowing borrowers to transfer their mortgage to a new home, subject to approval)."

"Rate Buy-Down Information"                                             , "Y"    , "Yes. Meridian allows brokers to buy down the interest rate by up to 15 bps (0.15%) at the cost of a commission reduction. Each 5 bps rate reduction costs 20 bps of the broker’s commission. The borrower must still qualify under standard GDS/TDS ratios, and the buy-down request must accompany the submission."
"Rate Drop Policy"                                                      , "N"    , "(Not mentioned in the provided document.)"

"Sliding Scale"                                                         , "Y"    , "Yes. Meridian uses a sliding scale on high-value properties. For example, for owner-occupied properties: they will lend 80% LTV on the first $1–2 million and 50% on the portion above that (overall cap $2.25M). In GTA markets, the first-tier threshold is $2.0M; outside GTA it’s $1.0–1.5M."

Features of their VRM include the ability to port to a new property or refinance via blend-and-extend. A VRM can be paid out before maturity with a 3-month interest penalty (instead of an IRD)."
"What Rate Are Penalties Calculated At"                                 , "Y"    , "Meridian calculates payout penalties using their posted (floor) rates – the IRD is based on the original posted rate for the mortgage and the posted rate corresponding to the remaining term at time of break. (For variables, 3 months’ interest is charged.)"
"Agricultural/Agricultural Zoning"                                      , "Y"    , "Not allowed as residential deals. Meridian will not finance properties that are primarily agricultural. Working farms or hobby farms do not qualify, and any rural property must be within 50 km of an urban center (pop. ≥ 15,000) to be considered residential."
"AirBnB/Short Term Rental Properties"                                   , "Y"    , "Not allowed. Short-term vacation rental properties (e.g. homes intended for Airbnb/VRBO use) are ineligible for Meridian mortgages."

"Farms"                                                                 , "Y"    , "Not allowed. Meridian will not finance working farm properties (these are outside the scope of residential lending).

"Grow Ops"                                                              , "Y"    , "Not allowed. Properties identified as former grow-ops (marijuana grow houses), whether remediated or not, are not accepted by Meridian."

Laneway or carriage homes on the same title as the main property are acceptable only if they meet all Meridian’s criteria: the laneway unit must share the same PIN as the main house, have proper permits, be a self-contained year-round dwelling (with kitchen and bath) at least 350 sq. ft., and be smaller than the main house. The main house must be owner-occupied, and if the laneway home is rented out, it will be treated under Meridian’s rental income policy."

"Minimum Population Requirement"                                        , "Y"    , "For rural properties, Meridian requires the property to be within 50 km of a town with at least 15,000 population. (They focus on areas with reasonable population density for marketability.)"
"Minimum Square Footage (Condo)"                                        , "Y"    , "Meridian prefers condo units to be 550 sq. ft. or larger. Condo units under 550 sq. ft. outside the GTA require high-ratio insurance regardless of LTV. Within the GTA, units under 550 sq. ft. can be considered without insurance only if they meet strict criteria: Beacon score ≥ 680, a private 3-piece bathroom and kitchen inside the unit (no shared facilities), building age ≤ 10 years, and not a conversion project."
"Minimum Square Footage (House)"                                        , "Y"    , "For freehold houses smaller than 550 sq. ft., Meridian requires that the home have standard living facilities (living area, kitchen, a 3-piece bath, and a separate bedroom with a door). A full appraisal is required, and high-ratio insurance is required regardless of LTV for such small homes."
"Mixed Use (Commercial/Residential)"                                    , "Y"    , "Not in broker channel. Mixed-use properties (part residential, part commercial) are not funded through Meridian’s residential broker program. (These would be considered commercial deals.)"
"Mobile Homes/Modular Homes"                                            , "Y"    , "Restricted. Mobile homes, trailer homes, or properties in mobile home communities are not eligible. Pre-fabricated (modular) homes are only acceptable if they are permanently affixed to land on a proper foundation with all standard services in place."
"Non-Legal Rental Unit Allowed"                                         , "Y"    , "No. Meridian requires any rental units to be legal/conforming. The property’s rental suite must meet municipal zoning and fire code regulations. An illegal or non-conforming rental unit would not be acceptable to Meridian."
"Off Grid Properties"                                                   , "Y"    , "Likely not. Meridian stipulates that all properties must have at least 100 Amp electrical service. A fully off-grid property (without standard power hookup) would not meet this requirement and thus would not qualify."
"Past Foreclosures on Property"                                         , "N"    , "(Not mentioned in the provided document.)"

Meridian will consider financing Power of Sale purchases, but a full appraisal is required (and if an appraisal wasn’t originally addressed to Meridian, an exception and re-address letter are needed)."

Meridian only declines non-conventional construction types (for example, dome houses are explicitly not allowed), so typical wood-frame builds are fine."
"Consent To Release Client Information"                                 , "Y"    , "Meridian does not provide a generic consent form for brokers. Brokers must obtain a signed consent from each client to release information to Meridian. (In short, brokers need the applicants’ written consent, as Meridian won’t supply a separate form for this.)"
