Appraisals:�Due to the difficulty of setting market values for luxury homes, 2 full appraisals from independent appraisers must be completed when:
In�GTA: the total mortgage aggregate is $2MM or higher OR $1.5MM or greater in total mortgage borrowings with any of the following: Exception to Sliding Scale or Properties with 2-4 units.

Should the subject property be unique, or comparable sales are difficult to obtain for the purpose of deriving value, additional field review appraisals, desk review appraisals, and/or broker price opinions may be ordered to substantiate the property's value.
When 2 appraisals are completed, Meridian will base the lending value on the lower of the two values.
Appraisals
Most conventional mortgage & Line of Credit requests must be supported by an appraisal. Brokers are responsible for the cost of the appraisal report. �Full appraisals must be ordered through Nationwide Appraisal Services (NAS), Solidifi, or RPS Real Property Solutions (RPS).
AVM valuations and Market Rent appraisals must be ordered through Nationwide Appraisal Services (NAS). Ensure you select either �REAVS or MPAC as these are the�exclusive AVM types that are accepted.

Full Appraisal may be required at Underwriter�s discretion or where the purchase price does not fall within the low to high range of the AVM report.
Property valuation requirements: For Owner Occupied principal�residences, regardless of value, if LTV is less than 50% and beacon score is 600 or above, we'll move to AVM instead of full appraisal.
